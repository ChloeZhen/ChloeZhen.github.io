    <h1> Funny Illustrator </h1>
    <p>

        
        Illustrator is funny. It's not very difficult, but it needs a more familiar operating ability to be handy. I think the work made with it will be very expressive. I know that a lot of beautiful posters are also made through Illustrator. I hope I can learn more skills of this.
